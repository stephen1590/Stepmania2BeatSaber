# Stepmania to Beat Saber

## What is this?

Converts Stepmania (*.sm) files to Beat Saber songs.

Will attempt to perform some corrective mesaures to make the song "translate" into a more fluid Beat Saber song.

### Translate Patterns

Maps a simple set of Stepmania patterns to their Beat Saber equivalents.

### Resolve Conflicts

Identifies common conflicts/oddities and will find alternatives in order to improve Beat Saber gameplay.

### Resolve Repeats

Stepmania often has repetitive "double taps" - this will force the notes to alternate directions, allowing for more fluid Beat Saber movements.

### Apply Obstances

Does what you think - adds obstacles. These will be derived by note "holds" in Stepmania.
